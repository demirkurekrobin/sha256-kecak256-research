# Keccak-256 Cryptanalysis using AI & Quantum Randomness  

## ðŸ”¬ Researching Keccak-256 security using AI & quantum random generators

ðŸš€ **This project investigates Keccak-256 security using AI, procedurally generated data, and quantum random generators.**
My previous research on SHA-256 showed a statistical anomaly in the message scheduler that allows prediction of `w15` values â€‹â€‹with twice the probability.
Now I'm applying the same methodology to Keccak-256 to identify potential vulnerabilities and make Ethereum more secure.

## ðŸ”‘ Features & Methodology

**AI-supported cryptanalysis:** Deep learning models with TensorFlow for pattern recognition in Keccak-256

**Quantum random generator:** Generates high-entropic training data to eliminate overfitting

**Procedurally generated data:** Gigabyte-wide data sets for robust training data generation and prevention of overfitting, the training data set includes 300 million hashes

**Cython & low-level C optimization:** Performance boost for extremely high hash rate processing

**SHA-256 findings as a basis:** Extension of the successful SHA-256 analysis to Keccak-256
